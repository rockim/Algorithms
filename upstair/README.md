2. Do not step on all three successive steps.(However, the starting points is not included in the stairs)

3. The final arrival stairs must be stepped on.

Write a program that calculates the maximum of the total points you can earn in this game given the points on each step.

# Input
First line is number of stairs

After Second line, each line is score of stairs. 

number of stairs is Natural number smaller than 301, and Points of stairs are natural smaller than 10,001


# Output
print maximum of score that earn in the game 


# Howtosolve

one code is using dp with recursive function

another code(upstair2.py) is using dp with loops
