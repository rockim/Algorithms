# Problem
There are three operations that can caculate at int X

1. If X goes to 3, divide by 3
2. If X goes to 2, divide by 2
3. X= X-1


Given an integer N, we want to make 1 using the three operations above.
Print the minimum number of count to use the operation.

# Input
1<= N <= 10^6

# How to solve
Solve using dynamic programming with backtracking
