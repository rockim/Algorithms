# Problem

By using fibonacci function, make a program that print how many number of each 0,1 with given N

# Input

First input is testcase T

Each test case is consisted of 1 line, and N is given. N is natural number and 0.

# Output

For each test case, print the number of outputs 0 and 1s are separated by spaces.

# How to solve

When using Fibonacci functions, backtracking can be used to reduce algorithm time. I created and used an array to store the result of the Fibonacci function.
We can know when N is 0 and 1 what output is. To save tiem, I saved it in an array.
